    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 11 NOV 2025 -- I can't stop thinking about our consumption of media. </p>
    
    <p class="indented-block">
        I recently watched one of the John Green videos on the vlogbrothers channel, and John compares our consumption of media in a similar way to our consumption of food. <br>
        Through much of the history of humans, we have suffered of famine. Now we live in an age were we have too much food. We can now afford to make food better and better. <br>
        Companies and food suppliers are fighting for our consumption, and they do so in two ways. One, making food taste as perfectly great as possible. And two, making the <br>
        satiability lie within a goldilocks range that allows peope to eat more and more. 
        <br> <br>
        The analogy here with food as our media was exactly what I have been looking for, John.
        <br> <br>
        I am worried about own health when it comes to my media consumption. Why is it that we can sink our time so easily and not even realize what we have done.<br>
        I am reminded of the opioid episodes where a person can die from their body fully slowing down. I am reminded of the experiement where rats, when able to <br>
        stimulate their pleasure centers (I believe it was the VTA) would continue pressing the button until they die. <br>
        WE CONTNINUE SCROLLING WITHOUT A CONCIOUS SENSE OF IT...
        <br><br>
        Should we be putting more attention into this? Is this not a global mental health crisis waiting charging up?
        <br>
        I need to polish my understanding here.<br>
